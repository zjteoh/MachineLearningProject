Machine Learning Project
========================

**1. Introduction**
---------------
This project is the final project of the Machine Learning class that I took. This project
is a "replication" of the original project by Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil titled "An Empirical
Comparison of Supervised Learning Algorithms" - 2006 but in a smaller scale. Here, we only
compare five different supervised learning algorithms namely boosted trees, random forests,
support vector machines, logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors.

The purpose of this project is to compare these five different classifiers performance across
a variety of publicly avaialble datasets.

The project is coded in Jupyter Notebook (Python 2.7) and a report on the classifiers performance
is provided as well.

**2. Datasets**
-----------
The datasets in this project were taken from UCI Machine Learning repository. Some of the datasets
are binary classifcation while some are not (more than binary). The datasets used in this project
are listed below

- Adult (Census Income) -
- Skin -
- Bank Marketing -
- Connect-4 - 
- Letter Recognition -
- Nursery -
